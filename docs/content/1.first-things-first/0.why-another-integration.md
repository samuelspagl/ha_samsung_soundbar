# ‚ùì Why another integration

The current Samsung Soundbar Integration by @PiotrMachowski / @thierryBourbon are already pretty cool.
But I wanted it to appear as a device, and base the Foundation on the `pysmartthings` python package.

Additionally, I wanted full control over the *Soundmode* and more. So I tried out a few things with the API,
and found that also the **Subwoofer** as well as the **Equalizer** are controllable.

I created a new wrapper around the `pysmartthings.DeviceEntity` specifically set up for a Soundbar, and this
is the Result.

I hope to integrate also controls for **surround speaker** as well as **Space-Fit Sound**, but as these features
are not documented... ;)
