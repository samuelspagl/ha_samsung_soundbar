Yassi - Yet another Samsung Soundbar integration

#description
**YASSI** is a **HomeAssistant** integration for **Samsung Soundbars**. It enhances control, and adds features like equalizer settings. Install it via HACS or manually. Kudos to the original idea by @PiotrMachowski and @thierryBourbon! 🎶🔊
