# Getting Started

## Installation

### HACS (official)

> ⚠️ Not done yet, hopefully soon.


### HACS (custom repository)

You can add this repository as a custom repository to your hacs.
After you've done that, you can search for it like with the "official"
integrations.

### Manual

Copy the contents of `custom_components/samsung_soundbar` to `config/custom_components/samsung_soundbar`
on your HomeAssistant instance.

## Configuration

After you installed the custom component, it should be possible to configure the integration
in the `device` settings of your HomeAssistant.

You will need:
- a SmartThings `api_key` [click here](https://account.smartthings.com/tokens)
- the `device_id` of your device [click here](https://my.smartthings.com/advanced/devices)
- a name for your Soundbar
- and a `max_volume`
